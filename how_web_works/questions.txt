1. HTTP is the protocol that connects the users side of the internet to the servers that hosts it. HTTP allows the user to make requests and fetch data from servers.

2. A URL is the address that the user will search up in order to find the site that they need. The URL is what allows the server to give the user the correct websites to display.

3. A DNS is the domain name structure and it is like the phonebook of the internet. The DNS connects the  user readable URL to the computer readable IP address.

4. A query string is a string that is passed into a URL when the user inputs a submission form like a search item and this allows the database to pull up the correct results.

5. two HTTP verbs are GET AND POST. Both are similar with one major difference. GET is used when the user is not going to manipulate the database at all ie just viewing the page and POST is used when the database data is going to be manipulated ie when the user submits a form to be placed in the database.

6. An HTTP request is the user going onto a web page and the 'asking' the server to give the files to their computer.

7. An HTTP response is the server actually giving those files back to the users computer.

8. An HTTP header is meta data about the site being served to the computer. An example is the header content-language. This will tell the users computer what language the site needs to be served in.

9. The processes that happen when the user types a url into the browser is.
    The computer will find the correct IP associated with the URL
    
    The computer will send a request to the server that the requested site is hosted on

    The server will respond with the data in the site.

    The data will be parsed through and translated back into readable HTML and JS etc by the computer.

    The users computer will render the data of the site in the browser.
